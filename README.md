# 🚗 RFID-Based Toll Gate Automation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project automates toll collection using **RFID technology**.  
Each vehicle is equipped with an RFID tag linked to a prepaid wallet.  
When the vehicle passes through the toll gate:
- The **RFID reader** detects the tag
- The system verifies the vehicle in the **database**
- The toll fee is **deducted automatically**
- The **gate barrier opens** if balance is sufficient

This reduces congestion, improves efficiency, and ensures transparency.

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. Vehicle approaches toll gate  
2. RFID tag scanned → tag ID sent to Arduino  
3. Arduino passes ID to backend API  
4. Backend checks database for balance  
5. If balance is valid → deduct fee + update transaction  
6. Gate opens (Servo motor triggered)  
7. React Dashboard shows live vehicle status

## 🚧 Major Challenges & Solutions
- **Real-time communication** → Solved using serial communication + APIs  
- **Concurrent vehicle entries** → Used timestamp-based unique logs  
- **Database performance** → Added indexing & caching  
- **Dummy data for testing** → Created simulated RFID test dataset  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Predict congestion at toll gates using **historical traffic data** + ML models  
- Add mobile app for wallet recharge and live toll tracking  
- Enable multi-gate synchronization for smart highways
